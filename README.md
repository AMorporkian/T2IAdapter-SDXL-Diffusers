# T2I-Adapters & Training code for SDXL in Diffusers

This is the initial code to make T2I-Adapters work in SDXL with Diffusers. The UNet has changed in SDXL making changes necessary to the diffusers library to make T2IAdapters work. I intend to upstream the code to diffusers once I get it more settled. A training script is also included.
